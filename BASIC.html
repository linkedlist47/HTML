The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:
  
Tag	Description
<abbr>	Defines an abbreviation or acronym
<address>	Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document
<bdo>	Defines the text direction
<blockquote>	Defines a section that is quoted from another source
<cite>	Defines the title of a work
<q>	Defines a short inline quotation

Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
 The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
